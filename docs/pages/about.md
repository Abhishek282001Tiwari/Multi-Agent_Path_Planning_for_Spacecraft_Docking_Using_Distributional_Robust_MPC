# About This Project

The Multi-Agent Spacecraft Docking System represents a comprehensive implementation of advanced control theory and multi-agent coordination for autonomous space operations.

## Technical Foundation

This system implements Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control (DR-MPC) to handle uncertainties inherent in space environments including:

- Spacecraft dynamics modeling errors
- External disturbances (solar radiation pressure, atmospheric drag)
- Sensor noise and measurement uncertainties
- Actuator performance variations

## System Architecture

The architecture follows aerospace software engineering best practices with modular design:

- Agent-based spacecraft representation
- Distributed control algorithms
- Robust optimization techniques
- Comprehensive safety systems
- Real-time visualization capabilities

## Research Background

This work builds upon established research in model predictive control, multi-agent systems, and spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control. The distributionally robust approach provides theoretical guarantees for safe operation under uncertainty.

## Applications

The system is designed for various space mission scenarios:

- International Space Station servicing
- CubeSat constellation operations
- Deep space exploration missions
- Orbital debris mitigation
- Commercial space operations

## Development

The project follows professional software development practices including comprehensive testing, continuous integration, and production-ready deployment configurations.
